# OBS-Studio-Package-PTZ-Jimcom-Portable

This is a portable Windows x64 PC version of OBS Studio packaged with PTZ and other great features for quick start as recommended by [Jimcom USA](https://www.jimcom.us/). There will be numerous plug-ins added to this portable version of [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/), each plug-in may have a different license agreement. We will post that in the table below when known. Jimcom USA is providing this compilation of plug-ins to help users with/without Jimcom PTZ cameras to get started faster with their product. The "main" branch will contain the merge of all the products/files as a staging for the Portable implementation of OBS Studio with the supplied features.

This installer is for anybody with the follow use:

* One or more Portable Version of OBS Studio
* PTZ Cameras
* NDI based cameras
* Professional Broadcasts
* Content Recording 

For support with this install or after completing this install, go to the [Jimcom USA OBS Studio Portable PTZ](https://www.jimcom.us/obs-studio-portable/) page or directly to the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/c5NWCrWK22/). OBS Studio or the Plug-In communities cannot help you with any issues with this installation utility.

**Please note:** Some features such as NDI will require you to perform additional steps outside of this plug-in. This is the case where the software License does not allow for distribution of the executables. In these cases, the comments will have a link to guide you in completing the installation of that feature.
